├── index.html       # Main HTML file
├── calendar.css     # Styling for the calendar
├── calendar.js      # Script to update the calendar dynamically

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. The calendar will display the current date dynamically.

## How It Works
1. **HTML**:
   - Contains a simple structure with placeholders for the month name, day name, day number, and year.
2. **JavaScript**:
   - Uses the `Date` object to retrieve the current date.
   - Updates the DOM elements (`#month-name`, `#day-name`, `#day-number`, `#year`) with the appropriate values.
3. **CSS**:
   - Provides a visually appealing layout with centered content and a soft color palette.

## Future Enhancements

- Highlight the current day in a full monthly calendar view.
